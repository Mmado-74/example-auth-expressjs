## Introduction

In today's digital landscape, securing your applications is more important than ever. This guide will walk you through the steps needed to implement authentication in your Express.js app. We will use ZITADEL for identity management and Passport.js for authentication strategies.

## Getting Started

To begin, you need to have a basic understanding of Express.js and Node.js. If you're new to these technologies, consider reviewing the official documentation for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/) and [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html).

## Installation

You can clone this repository to get started. Use the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mmado-74/example-auth-expressjs.git
```

After cloning, navigate into the directory:

```bash
cd example-auth-expressjs
```

Next, install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Configuration

To configure ZITADEL for your application, you will need to create an account on the ZITADEL platform. Once you have an account, follow these steps:

1. **Create a new project** in ZITADEL.
2. **Configure the OIDC settings**:
   - Set the redirect URIs to your applicationâ€™s callback URL.
   - Note your client ID and client secret.

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following environment variables:

```env
ZITADEL_ISSUER=<your-zitadel-issuer>
ZITADEL_CLIENT_ID=<your-client-id>
ZITADEL_CLIENT_SECRET=<your-client-secret>
ZITADEL_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/auth/callback
```

## Usage

To start the application, run:

```bash
npm start
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser. You will see the home page. From there, you can initiate the authentication process.

### Authentication Flow

1. **Login**: Click the login button to start the OIDC flow.
2. **Redirect**: You will be redirected to the ZITADEL login page.
3. **Callback**: After successful authentication, ZITADEL will redirect you back to your application.

### Logout

To log out, navigate to the logout endpoint:

```plaintext
GET /auth/logout
```

This will clear your session and redirect you to the home page.

## Features

- Secure authentication using OIDC.
- Support for PKCE flow.
- Easy integration with Passport.js.
- Session management.
